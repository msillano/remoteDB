# remoteDB
This is my attempt to define a 'good' database for IRPs and to use with irp_classes (https://github.com/msillano/irp_classes)
It must be a starting point for building home automation applications.
As a demo of remoteDB capabilities, this is an application to perform a simple replica of standard IR remote controls.
You can see it as an example of using remoteDB and the included php libraries you can use in your IR applications.
