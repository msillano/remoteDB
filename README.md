# remoteDB
remoteDB is my tentative definition of a 'good' Data Base for IRP storage, to work with irp_classes and build 'good' user-oriented 
IR applications. 
This DB can be used for WEB home applications, but also on more exigent conditions e.g. to do sites like irdb that creates data set 
and raw codes on demand.
