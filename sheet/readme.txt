This directory cntains:
 - file txt for demo and full keys definitions
 - one example lirc file
 - rem_xxxxx_sheet.txt, with data of 4 remote controls.
note:
  keep a compressed version of original files (sheet.zip) 
  because is very easy to overvrite this files.
  The original version allows you to rebuild remoteDB database.
note:
  using the tool 'fill irp_actions from text file', take care because the last file
  overwrite all informations: so import before key_full.txt and after 
  key_demo.txt: this as better key definitions than key_full.txt
